# Programming-portfolio

Hi, I’m Zachary Daher. I’m a West Point cadet graduating in 2026. 

This repository highlights projects that demonstrate my experience in 
projects that I enjoyed. Look at my Github https://github.com/Zac-daher and the listed links below for repositories.
## Featured Projects
# 1. WILD — Agentic AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (NSA / Johns Hopkins)
A research project exploring agentic AI systems built around retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) due to limitations from data team as well and computing power. The main scope of the project
was focused on exploring how agentic AI systems can support
battlefield triage and decision support. The software uses Roboflow to train the camera to detect 
what the camera is looking at, then uses a RAG version of blip to then associate the image (battlefield patient)
with an associated category of injury. The result will then be displayed on the server after all of these agentic decisions are made. 

# 2. Lamp Stack Cloud Computing
A containerized, LAMP-style cloud application built using Python, Docker, and a locally hosted small language model (SLM) accessed through an API.
Each layer of the stack (web server, database, and model service) runs in a separate container.

# 3. Orchestration Cloud Computing
A small Python based container orchestration project that has deployment of containers,
monitoring of health, and auto-scaling of container usage, behavior using Docker, Traefik, and custom logic.
This project focuses on understanding how orchestrators manage container load
and availability.

# 4. Parallel Threading in C
A low-level systems programming project written in C that examines parallel
threading, synchronization, and performance tradeoffs. The project emphasizes
understanding how multithreaded programs behave at the system level.

# 5. OptiFit — Real time data AI Workout Generator (optimal fitness plan)
A Flask-based fitness application that generates daily workout plans based on
recovery metrics (some being HRV, sleep, stress, and user goals). The application
constructs structured prompts and takes real time data from Garmin's API for now, but will
be connected to whoop, Aura, apple watch soon. Based on the user's data, the LLM generates a 
workout with respect to the user's goal.
