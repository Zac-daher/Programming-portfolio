# Programming-portfolio

Hi, I’m Zachary Daher. I’m a West Point cadet graduating in 2026. 

This repository highlights projects that demonstrate my experience in 
projects that I enjoyed.

## Featured Projects
#1. WILD — Agentic AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (NSA / Johns Hopkins)**
A research project exploring agentic AI systems built around retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) due to limitations from data team as well and computing power. The main scope of the project
was focused on exploring how agentic AI systems can support
battlefield triage and decision support.
The system grounds model outputs in curated, task-specific data
rather than relying on a standalone language model. Work focused on RAG design,
model adaptation, local vs. cloud LLM tradeoffs, and security considerations for
sensitive decision-support use cases. 

# 2. Lamp Stack Cloud Computing
A containerized, LAMP-style cloud application built using Python, Docker, and a locally hosted small language model (SLM) accessed through an API.
Each layer of the stack (web server, database, and model service) runs in a separate container.

# 3. Orchestration Cloud Computing
A small Python based container orchestration project that has deployment of containers,
monitoring of health, and auto-scaling of container usage, behavior using Docker, Traefik, and custom logic.
This project focuses on understanding how orchestrators manage container load
and availability.

# 4. Parallel Threading in C
A low-level systems programming project written in C that examines parallel
threading, synchronization, and performance tradeoffs. The project emphasizes
understanding how multithreaded programs behave at the system level.

### 5. OptiFit — AI Workout Generator
A Flask-based fitness application that generates daily workout plans based on
recovery metrics such as HRV, sleep, stress, and user goals. The application
constructs structured prompts and calls an LLM API to return a safe workout
including warm-up, main workout, and cool-down sections.

Planned future work includes integrating wearable APIs (e.g., Garmin),
adding user profiles and workout history, and strengthening safety constraints
and input validation.
